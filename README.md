# Build requirements
The files in the styles folder should not be changed directly, to update the styles
update the source files in the scss folder and ensure that `yarn sass` is watching 
for source changes.

All files should be committed to the repo so that they are available to github pages.

# Todo
- Build out SCSS theme
  - set this up to allow each page to provide a simple override to the main theme,
  so that while all pages are using the same SCSS their appearance may differ, for
  example, the colour palette for each page may vary. 
- Create a basic web page structure
- Build out a bit of content for a few pages

# Changelog
## Initial project set-up
- Added prettier and sass to yarn for use in the dev environment
- styles, scss and images folder to keep the project organised
