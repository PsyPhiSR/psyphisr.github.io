        <p>
          The German word 'Gestalt' means 'shape' or 'form'. At the beginning of
          the twentieth century a number of psychologists, started to look at
          the way we perceive the world, and defined several interrelated
          concepts into a cohesive theory. As designing has matured, designers
          have looked to psychology to help to understand how the design of
          something might be inteprited by an individual. Now many designers
          reference and refer to the Gestalt Principles to help shape their
          compositions.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Gestalt can also be thought of as 'unified whole' or as the whole is
          more than the sum of the parts. It is sometimes worded as
          <em
            >the whole is <strong>different</strong> from the sum of its
            parts.</em
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The Principles of Gestalt describes the general tendancies for human
          perception of objects and groupings. It is a mixture of Pychology and
          Perceptive sciences and design principles. Due to the nature of the
          Gestalt Principles, it can be difficult to talk about one without
          talking about others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google search for <strong>Gestalt Principles</strong> will result in a
          lot of confussion about how many there are and what they are called.
          This is in part due to modern thinking expanding the original
          principles and others trying to clarify the principles. In this
          presentation, I have just chosen some of the most popular names for
          each principle, and added others to the list where I found that one
          website mentions something a little bit differently to another.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important realise that most of the words below are only one side
          of a two sided coin (so to speak). For example, if we talk about
          concepts like Similarity, Proximity and Symmetry, we can also talk
          about the opposite of the concept: dissimilar, distance and asymmetry.
          Just because this list contains one of the words does not mean that
          the opposite is bad.

          Please note that what follows is just scratching the surface. It is
          whirlwind tour of a hundred different website, blog posts and
          articles, on design, Gestalt and building websites in general. Please
          take it as an attempt to share somethings I have only recently learned
          and may have completely backwards.

                The Law of Similarity shows that the brain tends to group
                objects together if they share the some characteristics. This
                may be colour, shape, style, size, it could be based on
                alignment or even location.

                Notice how all the dots are the same size, but some are
                different because of colour or alignment (position), so you
                could view this as two groups or as four groups, and both are
                equally valid. If you think about it you would be willing to say
                that this is two groups with three subgroups in the first. We
                will return to this image below in another principle.

                We could view the above as three rows of four or four colums of
                three. But we are likely to think that there is something
                special or different about the one that is purple.

                The brain will also add things to multiple groups automatically.
                So components on a web page, may be identified by a style (like
                the underlined text of a link), which maybe part of a card with
                an image, Title and description text. Products may include a
                price that would easily be picked out due to alignment,
                position, or style of the text.

                This, of course, assumes that when it is being designed or
                coded, that we are being consistent with the styling of similar
                functioning components, like, a link, button or larger
                component. This is where a theme can help, and summary widget
                design sheet that shows styling as a low, intermediate, and high
                level.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note that the call to action <i>Buy now</i> button is styled in
                a different colour from the rest of the product card. Consistent
                use of the same patterns and colours helps a user to find what
                they want on a site.
              </p>
              <p>
                Consistency is not a Gestalt Principle but it doesn't mean it's
                not important. Consistency on a website or brand, builds
                identity and gives a sense of cohesion and purpose to each
                component and to the whole.
              </p>
              <p>
                We can also see that Intention is important, if the intention
                was to draw attention to the purple dot in the diagram above,
                then does the use of <i>difference</i> achieve that intention?

                Continuity is a principle that works on the minds tendancy to
                follow a line. It is in part about alignment but might also be
                orientation or orchestration, in the example below can you see
                the green boxes form both rows and columns, they help to draw
                the eye across the page and down.

                Another example of this is where Figure / Ground (see below) is
                used to draw the eye across the page.

                The idea of guiding the eye has lead web designer to define
                three basic models for websites. When looking at a particular
                website it may not for into one of those patterns. Also as they
                are basic, there may be others that I have not found yet in my
                travels.

                Note that continuation can be used to relate topics that "break"
                other principles, for example, you could create two groups of
                words or images where each item in the group is close to each
                others (implying a connect between them) then you could add a
                line from one element to an element in the other group (implying
                a different connection), each connection may be a different way
                to link the topics.

              <p>
                The Amazon logo shows a different use of this principle,
                expressing the idea that at Amazon you can get anything from A
                to Z, it also implies that Amazon will make you happy.

                In the example above, imagine that the dots are all one colour,
                you are likely to think that there is one straight dotted line
                across the page and that is curved. Adding in the colour makes
                it seem like the <i>lines</i> do not continue as expected.

              <p>
                Closure is an interesting one as it's about what is not there.
                Look at the example below, is there a white rectangle in the
                middle? The Law of Closure, states that human brain has a
                tendancy to fill in the blanks.

                A well known logo that has been made using the closure principle
                is the World Wildlife Fund&apos;s image. Is it a panda or is it
                just black blobs in a pattern? If you place the logo on a black
                backgound, you can see that there are two white blobs too.

                The Law of Proximity, of course, relates to the distance that
                elements are from each other. A simple grouping of links in a
                menu will point the user to how things might be related in the
                site.

              <p>
                In the example above you can see that there are three groups the
                logo, the links and maybe a link to login. After clicking on one
                of the link and being taken to a page, the user is likely to
                think that the other links would do the same but would not be
                surprised if the Login link did not do exactly the same, because
                it is separate from the other links in the header.

            <div class="content">
              <p>
                This principle encompasses both parts of the <i>coin</i>, the
                backgound (just called <i>ground</i>in this principle), and the
                foreground (figure or sometimes subject). For this principle,
                the figure and the ground can be swapped to create something
                different, a new idea.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is a famous picture of a vase that demonstrats this
                principle, or is it a picture of two people facing each other.
              </p>
              <img

              />
              <p>
                The principle of figure / ground is related to the Law of
                Closure, it is the work the mind does to understand a
                recognisable but incomplete image. It can be seen in many logos,
                like the bear in the mountain on the Toblerone, the arrow in the
                FedEx logo,
              </p>

              <img src="../images/fedex-express-6.svg" width="50%" />
              <p>
                From one viewpoint, the figure is foreground, while the ground
                is the scene or background in which the figure "stands". But
                with a small shift in perspective and the ground jumps out and
                becomes a new subject while the figure drops back to form a new
                background.

            <summary><h2>Symmetry</h2></summary>
            <div class="content">
              <p>
                If you fold a symmetrical figure in half the two sides will
                match up. A symmetrical design can often look pleasing to the
                eye, and is considered static, stable, safe, balanced.
                <strong>Balance</strong> or <strong>Order</strong> are other
                words that are sometimes used for this principle.
              </p>
              <img src="../images/6Symmetry_1-564x470.webp" />
              <p>
                Likewise, asymmetry is often associated with movement,
                instablity, rocking the boat, edgy. Depending on the brand an
                asymmetrical design can really punch a message home.

              <p>
                There is a German word used for this principle, <i>prägnanz</i>,
                the principle of organisation. It states that people tend to
                perceive forms as the simplest and most meaningful, stable, and
                complete structures that conditions permit. The word means
                something like <i>Good figure</i> or <i>pithiness</i> (literally
                defined as "brief, forceful and meaningful in expression").

                point or moving in the same direction.

        <h2>Other Design Principles</h2>
        <p>
          From the above you can see that this is only the beginning and within
          the the Gestalt Principles I have mentioned a number of other
          Principles. Let us briefly discuss them here.

            <summary><h3>Movement</h3></summary>
            <div class="content">
              <p>
                This is the idea that a design can convey a sense of movement or
                stillness.

            <div class="content">
              <p>
                You can find some sort of hierarchy in many design projects,
                from a simple page or menu structure to the relative sizes of
                headings.

            <div class="content">
              <p>
                We have a tendancy to think that bigger things are more
                important. We can use different proportions to draw attention to
                some details and de-emphasize an element by making it smaller.

            <div class="content">
              <p>
                As human beings we are good at recognising pattern, think of the
                times that you have seen a shape of something in the clouds, or
                a face in leaves of a tree. Designs often use this ability, to
                spark interest.

            <div class="content">
              <p>
                Unity is the idea that everything should work together. A user
                may be confused if we use designs that <i>say</i> different
                things unless we do so intentionally.

            <div class="content">
              <p>
                Time and time again, we seem to present things that contradict
                each other. In the last principle, we said a unity and here we
                are taking about, adding in variations.

            <div class="content">
              <p>
                Emphasis can be achieved in many ways, typeface, size, colour,
                position, etc.

            <div class="content">
              <p>
                This is the idea that a design has a sort of rhythm, similar to
                the idea of variety, a design can became boring if the same idea
                is used too consistently. Image a song that only plays one note
                in the same rhythm all the way through, you might listen to it
                once but probably not twice.
